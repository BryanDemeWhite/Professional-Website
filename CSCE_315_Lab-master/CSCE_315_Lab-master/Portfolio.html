    <p>Projects that I have worked on can be found in both my Personal GitHub and my TAMU GitHub.</p>
    <!--
    <p>I have worked on multiple DiscordBots in both C# and Python that I use in multiple servers that allow for tasks such as giving permissions, gererating images, and creating player accounts using JSON for mini-games.</p>
    <p>I have worked on a project that involved image manipulation in which I learned how to resize, seam carve and recolor images in C++.</p>
    <p>I created a Randomly Generated Dungeon RPG that dynamically generates new areas to explore as you enter new rooms in <a href="https://www.construct.net/en">Construct 3<a/>. It includes various different monsters to slay as well as randomized loot drops. This game includes shop and inventory function in which you can buy items with the currency you gain by defeating monsters</p>
    <p>I have also worked on numerous projects involving sorting and manipulation of large data sets. This involved asymptotic analysis of running time and memory usage. Where I analyzed algorithms based on performance and recognized trade-offs of different implementations. </p>
    <p>Another project I worked on is this website you are using right now. I used HTML, CSS and Javascript to make this website with the help of the Bootstrap library. The website includes multiple features such as icons, videos, images, and embedded pdfs. It also includes a toggleable button for switching the webpage to darkmode that persists across the entire website. Also, there are social media links as images that move when you hover over them.</p>
    <p>In the future, I'd love the opportunity to work on more game related programming projects as game development is an area that really interests me. Particularly love to get the opportunity to work on a Virtual Reality application in the future. I have done work in Unity and Blender while creating and editing 3d models for use in VR applications. </p>
